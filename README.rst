Schema - Analyze and Visualize Multimodal Single-Cell Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Schema is a Python library for the synthesis and integration of heterogeneous single-cell modalities.
**It is designed for the case where the modalities have all been assayed for the same cells simultaneously.**
Here are some of the analyses that you can do with Schema:

  - infer cell types jointly across modalities.
  - perform spatial transcriptomic analyses to identify differntially-expressed genes in cells that display a specific spatial characteristic.
  - create informative t-SNE & UMAP visualizations of multimodal data by infusing information from other modalities into scRNA-seq data.
    
Schema offers support for the incorporation of more than two modalities and can also simultaneously handle batch effects and metadata (e.g., cell age).


Schema is based on a metric learning approach and formulates the modality-synthesis problem as a quadratic programming problem. Its Python-based implementation can efficiently process large datasets without the need of a GPU.
